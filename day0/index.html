      <h2>Who am I?</h2>

      <p>Hi! I’m Aadi. I am a senior at Las Lomas High School and I love to swim and play board games. I actually own a lot of board games including BANG and Ticket to ride: Europe. One thing you need to know about me is that if you challenge me to a board game involving a lot of strategy, be prepared to lose. The most important thing I value is friendship. Great friendships can last a lifetime and it is important that you are close to someone, because at the end of the day they will be the one who is closest to you and be there for you at the weakest and strongest of times; and it will go both ways. </p>

      <h2>Do you know tech?</h2>

      <p>I love technology; the software and the hardware. I took Elements of Web Design (TIC), where I learn HTML and CSS, and I took Intro to Computer Programming at my high school where I learned java. I self learned the basics of C++, and I implemented it with an arduino to create a project for HOSA, a club at my school, and competed to get 4th place in state. I also used C++ to create a robot for my school’s robotics club, and earned first place in regionals.</p>
