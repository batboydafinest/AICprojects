    Hello! My name is Justin Wong. I am 15 years old and will be a sophmore at Head Royce School this fall. My favorite subjects are math and computer science. I play competitive soccer for the Alameda Soccer Club, while playing basketball recreationally. I also enjoy playing video games in my spare time, with some of my favorites being Fortnite, League of Legends, Minecraft, and Overwatch.

    <h1> The Tech Me </h1>
    <p>
    I started coding in 6th or 7th grade when I joined a class that programmed with a Raspberry PI using bootstrap and Python. I then transitioned to Java, my main and favorite programming language, which I was introduced to in the Programming in Java <abbr title="Academic Talent Development Program"> ATDP </abbr> class and continued during the school year in a <abbr title="Mobile Object Oriented Design"> MOOD </abbr> class. Finally, I was exposed to <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language"> HTML </abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets"> CSS </abbr>, which I self-taught myself through the book, <em> HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</em>. Some of my most notable coding projects include...
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Scrabble Cheater </li>
        <li> Chat Webpage </li>
        <li> Hangman Game </li>
        <li> Minesweeper Game </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    I hope to further expand my coding knowledge through this Web Development class. 
    </p>
