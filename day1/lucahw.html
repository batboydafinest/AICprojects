		My name is Luca Snoey. I love to play videogames and watch Netflix, though I also like playing board games. I value being kind and honest i guess...I like to play soccer and tennis, and I enjoy hanging out with friends
		and family.

	<h1>Part 2: The Tech Me</h1>
	<p>
		I have enjoyed programming and tech since I was in middle school. In the summer before 7th grade, I went to a camp for Scratch/Java, then I went to a camp before 8th grade for Java programming. Then, I took a small compsci course in 8th grade that was a little underwhelming, but interesting nonetheless. My experience truly kicked off when taking AP Computer Science in 9th grade. Although I have not taken a class on html/css, I have taken many little lessons online and have worked on a project containing both those languages. I mostly taught myself. I know Java, and I guess a little HTML/CSS. I worked on a Java tower defense game with a friend in 9th grade, and also made an online chat program with another friend this year. In this class, I really want to learn how to manipulate servers, enhance my websites, etc...
